Hello All!

I'm Christopher Elhosni, a Biomedical Engineer interested in genetics, robotics, control systems, 3D Printing, and business.
In my free time, I like to tinker with Arduinos and 5V components, play guitar, workout, and read. 

I'm using GitHub to compile a summary of projects I have worked on, either at work (that I am permitted to disclose), at school, or at my leisure.
Hopefully something here will either help you, inspire you, or make you laugh.

-Chris
